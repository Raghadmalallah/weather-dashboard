## Description

For a traveler user and those who check the weather channel before planning to go out, I bulid an application that will help them find the weather condition for multiple cities using the API's for the OpenWeather [https://openweathermap.org/](https://openweathermap.org/) to get the accurate weather in the time that the user is logging in.


## Installation

I started analyzing the structure of the HTML and with the Javascript, using the bootstrap, jquery, Cloudflare, and simple CSS to finalize the final design that is user-friendly and color attraction to make it look more modern and fun.
